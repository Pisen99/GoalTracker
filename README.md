# GoalTracker

## Description
Trying to create a website where we keep track on our goals through life.
Where do we see ourselves in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years etc.
How do we get to that goal, what do we need to do to?
Setting a few smal goals on one part of the page that eventually will lead up to reach the bigger ones and mark it as done.

Breaking this down:
There will be 5 main goals (option to add more later on).
Each induvidual of these "5" goals will have a few smaller goals under it.
Representing everything we need to do to reach that big goal.
Once reaching one big goal it will unlock, alowing you to move on to the next big goal and so it will go on.
